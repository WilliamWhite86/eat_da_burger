# Eat_da_Burger

*Eat_da_Burger is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Uses MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM.*

* Credit goes to Cats app in-class activity from UNH Coding Bootcamp - I relied heavily on the Cats app example when building this.
* Thank you to my TA and Teacher
